## Overview

## Repository Contents


## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

- **Prerequisites:**
  In order to correctly install `speckcn2` you need `python3.9` or higher. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You will also need the header files that are required to compile Python extensions and are contained in `python3-dev`. On Ubuntu, you can install them with:
  ```bash
  apt-get install python3-dev
  ```

- **Install the package:**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install speckcn2
   ```

- **Or: Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MALES-project/SpeckleCn2Profiler.git
  cd SpeckleCn2Profiler
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  pip install .
  ```

## Usage

To use the package, you run the commands such as:

```console
python <mycode.py> <path_to_config.yml>
```

where `<mycode.py>` is the name of the script that trains/uses the `speckcn2` model and `<path_to_config.yml>` is the path to the configuration file.

[Here](https://males-project.github.io/SpeckleCn2Profiler/examples/run) you can find a typical example run and an explanation of all the main configuration parameter. In the [example submodule](https://github.com/MALES-project/examples_speckcn2/) you can find multiple examples and multiple configuration to take inspiration from.
